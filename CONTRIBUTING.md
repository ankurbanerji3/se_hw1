## Question?

> Hopefully the [README.md](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw1/blob/main/README.md) answers any questions you may have, but if not, here are a few things you can do:
- Look through the [Issues](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw1/issues) section to see if your query has been answered previously. If you aren't satisfied with the explanation/answer - you can add on your doubts as a reply to the issue.
- If you want to create a new issue for a previously unaddressed question, we suggest you to follow the given steps:
    - Open an [Issue](https://github.com/boscosylvester-john/se_hw1/issues/new).
    - Write in detail about the problem and specify the code if possible.
- The internet! - If you don't find help in any of the issues nor the documentation. We suggest you look throught the internet. Stackoverflow or framework documentations could be a real help!
We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.
